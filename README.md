I'm Eira, a web developer based in Barcelona. My curiosity for programming and the tech world motivated me to change careers and fully immerse myself in this field. I've learned on my own and also completed a web programming course on software development, where I developed skills in both front-end and back-end development. Previously, I worked as a linguist and web content editor, which is why I believe in the importance of clean and well-organized code.

 
## My projects

- :headphones: Apollofy: group project where we developed a music app similar to Spotify with Typescript, React, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, Express, Primsa, React-Testing-Library and Vitest and followed the Scrum methodology. 
- :clapper: Movie-hub: individual full-stack project to create a movie database, developed with NextJS, Typescript, Auth0, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, Express and Primsa.
